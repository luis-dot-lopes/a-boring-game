# a-boring-game
My first game made with SDL and C++

To compile this code, you can follow lesson 1 of this tutorial https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php to setup SDL.

In this game, you have to move the player (red ball) to the other side of the screen. If you hit one of the blue balls, you loose.
